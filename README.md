## **mini-GNI** - Miniature Giant Nucleus Impactor 

The mini-GNI is a small, 3D instrumentation created by the [Nugent Research Group](http://alisonnugent.com/) used to sample sea salt aerosol (SSA) aloft using ground-based platforms. Modeled off the [National Center for Atmospheric Research GNI](https://www.eol.ucar.edu/instruments/giant-nuclei-impactor), the mini-GNI combines Arduino based microcontrollers and 3D printed technology in order to expose polycarbonate slides to free airstreams, allowing SSA to impact onto them. Then, these slides are analyzed in by the same microscrope used by NCAR's GNI campaign and number concentrations and total mass are calculated.


### Mini-GNI Repository 

The mini-GNI repository is composed of several folders containing different python processing scripts.

To download this repository from GitHub, run:

```
  git clone https://github.com/nugentlab/miniGNI
```

To just download them individual parts and refer to the context in which the scripts are used, please refer to the appropriate subsection.
